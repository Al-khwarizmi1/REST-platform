# REST-platform
Modular platform build on slim with a Magento twist

The layout is pretty simple (if you know magento, it's even simpler) and so are the rules:

1) This app doesn't render frontend code (it can, but it wasn't made to)

2) The purpose of this is to handle communications between two systems

3) The way you call "actions" is similar to Magento:
    * Http://api.domain.com/ModuleName/Controller/Action/key1/value1/key2/value2...
    
Not too many bells and whistles
